# Booking Management System (Redux Middleware)

A simple **Booking Management System** built using **React** and **Redux** to manage flight bookings. This project demonstrates the use of custom middleware in Redux to handle actions, log state changes, and implement conditions based on future state.

## Features

- **State Management**: Uses Redux to manage the global state of flight bookings.
- **Custom Middleware**: Implements a custom Redux middleware to log state changes and handle conditions based on future state.
- **Alerts for Booking Success/Failure**: Based on the state of bookings, the application displays success or failure alerts.
